Scorekeeper is a work-in-progress mobile app which makes scorekeeping easy and fun. With a clean and intuitive interface, everyone will want to keep score!

## Development ##

I began working on this as a fun way to learn Flutter.

Features:
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Add an infinite number of players
- Automatically sorts players based on score
- Change between ascending/descending player score sorting
- Ability to reset players scores back to zero for a new game
- Modify each player's name and colour
